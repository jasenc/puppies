# Puppy Adoption Website

This website is being developed using Python, Flask, a few extensions that will be outlined in requirements.txt, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap.

Currently the database is loaded with some basic information for Shelters and Puppies and displays all information including CRUD functionality for both Shelters and Puppies.

## Installation

Clone, Fork, Download this repo and make sure you have Python and everything listed in requirements.txt installed either on your local or virtual machine. If so, navigate to the repository and run `python runserver.py` in your terminal. If that was successful go to `localhost:5000` in your browser and everything should be running.

## Development

Development for this project is currently on hold as priorities have shifted. As you will see below in the list of future improvements this project is relatively large. As such I am focusing my efforts on building out my porfolio and thuroughly understanding the basics.
